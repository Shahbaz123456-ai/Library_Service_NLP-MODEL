# Library_Service_NLP-MODEL
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict the appropriate library branch based on textual descriptions of location data. The goal is to classify text inputs like addresses or geographical information into specific library branches. By preprocessing the location data using techniques like text normalization and TF-IDF vectorization, the project extracts useful features for model training. A Logistic Regression classifier is then used to predict the library branch for new location inputs.Key technologies include Python, Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and TF-IDF for converting text data into meaningful numeric features. The model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting the correct library branch, making it a useful tool for location-based services.
Preprocessed location data through text normalization (lowercasing, removing punctuation, and cleaning).
Implemented TF-IDF vectorization to transform text into numerical features for model training.
Developed a Logistic Regression classifier to predict library branches based on location descriptions.
Achieved accurate classification results, improving the precision of branch identification.
